# **I) Become an AI Strategist**

# **A) Your Path from AI Strategist to AI Leader**

Hello and welcome to this executive briefing on generative AI and large language models for founders, managers, leaders, and executives. My name is Donna. I’m a two-time AI startup co-founder, a former managing director at JP Morgan, and I’ll be guiding you through this three-module journey into the world of AI. And what an incredible time it is to be involved in this field.

Normally, we would begin with a standard introduction: the structure of the course, the objectives, and so on. But instead of doing that, we’re going to dive straight into action. There will be plenty of time later to come back to the formalities. The area of AI that is generating the most excitement right now is agentic AI, and we’ll be spending a lot of time talking about it over the next couple of hours.

This, of course, is Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, who said earlier this year that he believes the first AI agents will actually join the workforce this year. Shortly after making that statement, OpenAI released their first professional agent in the form of the Operator agent, available to subscribers of the GPT Pro plan. Let’s take a quick look at it to get an immediate sense of what it means to have an AI agent working for you.

Most of you are probably familiar with ChatGPT and use it regularly. But this may be something you haven’t seen before. The Operator agent is an example of an AI process that has a level of autonomy. It can plan its own course of action, decide what to do, and then take actions. In other words, it has agency. To make this concrete, we gave it a task: to find a suitable team-building activity for a group of executives visiting New York in the summer.

What you see is that it begins reasoning about the problem, opens a browser, searches online, accepts cookies, fills in forms, researches options, and drills down into results. It performs the kinds of mundane tasks that a human would normally do, but it does them autonomously. Watching it analyze information and take action is absolutely fascinating.

After about five minutes, the Operator returned with a suggestion: a team-building activity called The Great Adventures in Comics by Midjourney, complete with supporting details. What’s most interesting is not just the result, but the process—seeing it reason, research, and then ask whether we’d like it to continue searching. I show you this to make the idea of an AI agent tangible. Throughout this briefing, we’ll talk about how to apply this technology to real commercial problems, and I want you to have a first-hand sense of what that looks like.

Now let’s talk about the objectives of this course. The overall goal of this briefing is to position you to drive transformative change in your organization using AI. The course is structured into three modules. The first module prepares you to be an AI strategist, capable of making strategy and investment decisions. The second module focuses on being a decision-maker at the intersection of technology, data science, and business. The third module develops your AI leadership skills—how to sponsor initiatives, recruit talent, identify risks, manage data, and deliver a roadmap with measurable return on investment.

Within each of these modules, there is a clear learning path. Becoming a strategist means building core knowledge and learning how to make informed investment decisions. Becoming a decision-maker means understanding the trade-offs and risks in key implementation choices. Becoming an AI leader means knowing how to hire the right skills, identify gaps, build a roadmap, manage research and development, ensure adoption, and prove ROI.

Throughout the course, we’ll examine real commercial applications, from tiny startups to Fortune 500 companies. By the end, you’ll be positioned to drive your own AI initiatives and deliver measurable business results. I strongly believe that these kinds of briefings should be actionable. There’s nothing worse than leaving with lots of ideas but nothing concrete to do. That’s why, at the end of each module, you’ll receive a toolkit that you can put into practice immediately.

The first toolkit is a framework for making strategy and investment decisions around AI initiatives. The second is a framework for implementation decisions—questions such as whether to build domain-specific models or use existing frontier models through paid APIs, always viewed from a commercial perspective. The third, and most important, is a framework for leading AI initiatives with measurable ROI: building roadmaps, accounting for R&D, managing experimentation, handling data, and developing the talent needed for long-term success.

To briefly introduce myself, my name is Donna. I’m the co-founder and CTO of Nebula, an AI startup where I lead software engineering and data science. I spent most of my career at JP Morgan as a managing director, leading a team of about 300 technologists. I began in London, moved to Tokyo, and now live in New York City. Before Nebula, I founded an AI startup called Untapped, which was acquired in 2021. The photo you see is from the Times Square billboard announcing that acquisition—a truly magical moment for me. I don’t show it just to boast, but also because I actually live about one block away from there.

And finally, you’ll see a personal photo of me about to fly a plane. You might think this is because flying is my passion—but quite the opposite. I show it to tell you that while I’m confident in AI, I am completely hopeless at anything involving hand-eye coordination. If you ever board a plane and see me in the cockpit, look for a parachute. But if you join an executive briefing on AI and see that I’m the one leading it, then you’re in the right place.

So, without further ado, let’s talk about what this course is—and what it is not. We will cover foundational knowledge about AI, but we won’t go deep into technical detail. Everything will be framed from a business perspective, equipping you to make strategic decisions. We’ll look at real-world commercial use cases across industries, and I’ll leave you with practical toolkits you can apply immediately, whether you’re a solo founder or a leader at a Fortune 500 company.

What we won’t do is dive into deep technical implementations. We’ll discuss concepts like agents, RAG, fine-tuning, and reasoning models, but always in the context of what you need to know to make business decisions. This is also not about teaching you how to use AI tools personally. Instead, it’s about how to lead your teams in using AI effectively in their work.

One final thing: you get me with the deal. I love answering questions, and I genuinely want you to ask them. You can connect with me on LinkedIn, email me, or reach out on X or YouTube, where I share AI insights for business audiences. I’m highly engaged, and if you contact me, I will respond as soon as I can. I also love building community—connecting business leaders and technologists working in this space—so please take me up on that.

And that concludes the first lecture of the first module. This session was about setting the stage, but we also gained an early, tangible insight into AI agents. I hope you now better understand what they are and why Sam Altman believes this is the year they enter the workforce. In our next session, we’ll begin with definitions and explore the AI landscape and technologies. Some of this may be familiar, and I’ll move quickly, but it’s essential groundwork for making sound business strategy decisions. I’ll see you then.

# **B) Core AI Terms Explained: LLMs, Transformers, Gen AI**

Welcome to lecture two. In this session, we begin talking about AI terms and the broader AI landscape. Some of this material may already be familiar, but the goal is to quickly cover the basic definitions while also explaining them in a way that adds something new for everyone. The content is designed for a wide audience, and if any parts feel too technical, there is no need to worry—we will move into a business-focused perspective very soon.

To start, a few key concepts are defined: artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, large language models, transformers, and agents. These definitions are presented not just in textbook terms, but also with real-world, practical interpretations of how these ideas are actually used in everyday business and technology conversations. The objective is to provide a solid foundation that will be useful later when we discuss strategy and commercial applications.

Artificial intelligence, in its textbook sense, refers to machines that exhibit intelligent behavior. The idea of machines being able to “think” was first formalized by Alan Turing in 1950 with the proposal of the Turing Test. Today, AI is used as an umbrella term covering traditional machine learning, deep learning, generative AI systems like ChatGPT, and even robotics. Interestingly, the term “AI” became heavily overused about a decade ago, appearing on every investor deck and website, which led to a kind of fatigue. Many organizations shifted toward talking about “automation” instead. However, the success of tools like ChatGPT has brought AI back into focus, and it is once again central to business and technology discussions.

Machine learning is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. While this definition can technically include generative AI, in everyday practice the term “machine learning” usually refers to traditional models used before the recent generative AI boom. These models rely on weighted combinations of features learned from data and are commonly used for tasks such as predicting credit risk, loan approvals, or house prices. This is typically what people mean when they talk about ML in business contexts.

Deep learning represents the modern AI approach and is based on neural networks with many layers—hence the term “deep.” Although neural networks date back to the 1950s, they experienced periods of limited success before reemerging strongly around 2010. Their resurgence was driven by increased computing power, vast amounts of data, and new techniques for organizing neural networks. One of the most important of these techniques is the transformer architecture, which made it possible to train extremely large and capable models.

Generative AI is the form of AI most associated with systems like ChatGPT. These models use deep neural networks to generate new content—text, images, audio, or video—based on an input known as a prompt. The model is trained to predict what is most likely to come next after a given input. For example, if the prompt asks for the capital of France, the model generates “Paris.” If the prompt asks for an image of Paris in a particular artistic style, the model attempts to produce that. This ability to generate new content is what defines generative AI.

A large language model (LLM) is a deep learning model designed specifically to understand and generate human language. Although the terms “LLM” and “generative AI” are often used interchangeably, they are not exactly the same. Some AI systems can generate images or videos without being language models, and some language models are designed for tasks other than generation. However, in most everyday discussions, the two terms are treated as referring to the same broad category of modern AI.

Transformers are a major breakthrough in AI architecture, introduced by Google in 2017. They provide an efficient way to connect different parts of a neural network, making it easier for models to learn patterns in large amounts of data. While transformers may not be fundamentally required for AI progress, they significantly accelerated development. Without them, today’s models would likely be several years behind current capabilities.

Large language models contain enormous numbers of internal settings known as parameters or weights. These can be thought of as sliders that control how the model responds to inputs. During training, these parameters are adjusted using massive datasets so that the model becomes increasingly accurate at predicting appropriate outputs. Two important phases of working with AI models are training and inference. Training involves learning from data and adjusting parameters, which can be extremely expensive and resource-intensive. Inference, by contrast, is simply running a trained model to produce outputs from new inputs—this is what happens every time ChatGPT is used.

The term “pre-trained” refers to models that have already been trained on vast amounts of data and can be used immediately. GPT itself stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. Building on this, the concept of agents refers to AI systems that have some autonomy in completing tasks. These systems can break complex goals into smaller steps and use language models to execute them, such as searching the web, interacting with tools, and completing workflows. Agentic AI is increasingly important in practical business applications.

At a high level, the AI ecosystem can be viewed in layers. At the bottom are the frontier labs—organizations such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Alibaba, and DeepSeek—that build foundational models. Above them are cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, which offer access to these models through scalable infrastructure. Surrounding this are frameworks, tools, and platforms such as Hugging Face, LangChain, vector databases, and deployment platforms that help businesses customize and operationalize AI.

At the top of this ecosystem are commercial products that apply AI to real-world tasks. These include developer tools like GitHub Copilot, business productivity tools like Microsoft Copilot, creative platforms such as Adobe Firefly, coding tools like Cursor, and industry-specific systems like Harvey for legal work or Salesforce Einstein for CRM and analytics. Some tools are general-purpose, while others are highly specialized for particular industries.

This overview provides a 10,000-foot view of the AI landscape. In the next session, the focus will move deeper into large language models themselves—comparing different models, understanding their strengths, and learning how to choose the right one for specific business needs.

# **C) Frontier vs Open-Source Models & How Choose**

It’s time for us to talk about large language models, or LLMs, and what makes them different from one another. As mentioned previously, there are three leading frontier labs that most people are familiar with. OpenAI is the most widely known. When you use ChatGPT, you can actually select between different models, each with different costs and capabilities. The most well-known is GPT-4, where the “O” stands for omni, meaning it can work with text, images, and audio. There is also GPT-4.5, currently their flagship model, available only to a limited group of users such as pro subscribers. GPT-4.5 is somewhat better than GPT-4, but not dramatically so.

Both GPT-4 and GPT-4.5 are examples of what are called chat models, sometimes referred to as instruct models. These are designed to take a prompt and generate the most likely response that should follow it. However, there is another category known as reasoning models. While similar in many ways, reasoning models are trained to first produce an internal thought process before generating a final answer. By explicitly reasoning through a problem before responding, these models often produce better outcomes. OpenAI’s flagship reasoning model is called O1, with a more affordable version known as O3 Mini. OpenAI has announced that future releases will merge chat and reasoning capabilities into a single model, starting with GPT-5, so that separate model categories will no longer exist.

The main competitor to OpenAI is Anthropic, also based in San Francisco and founded by former OpenAI employees. Their flagship model at the time of recording is Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which can operate in both chat and reasoning modes, effectively already combining the two approaches. The third major frontier lab is Google, whose leading models are Gemini 2.0 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash. These three labs represent the most advanced closed-source models available today. While all are widely used, personal preferences differ; many practitioners use multiple models in parallel and compare their outputs to get the best results.

These models are known as closed-source or paid models because their architectures and parameters are proprietary. Companies like OpenAI do not release details of their model internals or training data, as these represent enormous investments and form the core of their intellectual property. In contrast, there is a growing ecosystem of open-source models that anyone can download, run, and fine-tune. Meta led this movement with its LLaMA models, which allow users to access both the code and the trained parameters. Although some argue these are not “fully” open source because the original training methods and datasets are not disclosed, they are effectively open for practical use.

Among the most popular open-source models today are Meta’s LLaMA, Microsoft’s Phi models, Google’s Gemma series, X’s Grok models, Alibaba’s Qwen models, and DeepSeek’s models from China. Grok models are extremely large and are typically accessed through paid services, though the weights are available for download. Qwen models are particularly powerful and often outperform LLaMA and Phi in benchmark tests. DeepSeek’s models are especially notable: DeepSeek R1 is a reasoning model, while DeepSeek V3 is a chat model, both with an enormous 671 billion parameters. Smaller “distilled” versions of these models are also available, making them more practical for local use.

This overview of closed-source and open-source models is important because it forms the basis for later decisions about whether to use paid APIs or open-source models that can be customized internally. A common question is: which model is the best? In reality, that question has no universal answer. There is no single best model—only the right model for a specific business problem, budget, time to market, and risk profile. To compare models, practitioners often rely on public leaderboards that evaluate performance across tasks such as reasoning, coding, mathematics, and instruction following.

One useful resource is LiveBench, which runs models through difficult tests and ranks them accordingly. At present, Claude 3.7 Sonnet in reasoning mode ranks at the top, followed closely by OpenAI’s O3 Mini and X’s Grok 3 Thinking. DeepSeek R1 also performs extremely well. Another set of benchmarks comes from Scale AI’s SEAL leaderboards, which evaluate models on enterprise tool usage, coding, robustness, and even their resistance to being misled. These resources are typically used by technical teams, but understanding them helps business leaders engage meaningfully in AI strategy discussions.

There are three main ways to use large language models in commercial settings. The first is simply through a web interface, such as logging into ChatGPT and asking business-related questions directly. This is quick and accessible but limited in customization. The second is through APIs provided by companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, allowing organizations to embed AI into their own software and workflows. This approach enables fast development and integration into business applications, but it comes with ongoing costs and potential data security considerations, as information is processed in the cloud.

The third approach is to use open-source models directly by running them within your own infrastructure. In this case, your data never leaves your organization, and you can fine-tune the model to your specific domain. This offers maximum control and security but requires greater technical expertise, higher upfront costs, and longer development timelines. Each method has trade-offs in terms of cost, speed, customization, and data governance.

Sometimes, products built using APIs are described as “ChatGPT wrappers,” implying that they add little beyond simply calling a model behind the scenes. While this criticism can be fair in some cases, it is often overly simplistic. The way prompts are structured, how data is integrated, and how workflows are designed can add significant proprietary value. Similarly, when companies talk about building “domain-specific models,” they usually mean fine-tuning existing open-source models like LLaMA rather than creating entirely new foundation models from scratch.

This high-level overview of model types and usage approaches is intended to provide a foundation for future discussions. As we continue, we will examine different types of AI companies, offerings, and project strategies, helping you understand how to choose the right tools for specific business goals. In the next session, we will build on this knowledge and move into practical toolkits that show how these models are applied in real organizational contexts.
