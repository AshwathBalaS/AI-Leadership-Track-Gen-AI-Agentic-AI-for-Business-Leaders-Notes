# **A) Your Path from AI Strategist to AI Leader**

Hello and welcome to this executive briefing on generative AI and large language models for founders, managers, leaders, and executives. My name is Donna. I’m a two-time AI startup co-founder, a former managing director at JP Morgan, and I’ll be guiding you through this three-module journey into the world of AI. And what an incredible time it is to be involved in this field.

Normally, we would begin with a standard introduction: the structure of the course, the objectives, and so on. But instead of doing that, we’re going to dive straight into action. There will be plenty of time later to come back to the formalities. The area of AI that is generating the most excitement right now is agentic AI, and we’ll be spending a lot of time talking about it over the next couple of hours.

This, of course, is Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, who said earlier this year that he believes the first AI agents will actually join the workforce this year. Shortly after making that statement, OpenAI released their first professional agent in the form of the Operator agent, available to subscribers of the GPT Pro plan. Let’s take a quick look at it to get an immediate sense of what it means to have an AI agent working for you.

Most of you are probably familiar with ChatGPT and use it regularly. But this may be something you haven’t seen before. The Operator agent is an example of an AI process that has a level of autonomy. It can plan its own course of action, decide what to do, and then take actions. In other words, it has agency. To make this concrete, we gave it a task: to find a suitable team-building activity for a group of executives visiting New York in the summer.

What you see is that it begins reasoning about the problem, opens a browser, searches online, accepts cookies, fills in forms, researches options, and drills down into results. It performs the kinds of mundane tasks that a human would normally do, but it does them autonomously. Watching it analyze information and take action is absolutely fascinating.

After about five minutes, the Operator returned with a suggestion: a team-building activity called The Great Adventures in Comics by Midjourney, complete with supporting details. What’s most interesting is not just the result, but the process—seeing it reason, research, and then ask whether we’d like it to continue searching. I show you this to make the idea of an AI agent tangible. Throughout this briefing, we’ll talk about how to apply this technology to real commercial problems, and I want you to have a first-hand sense of what that looks like.

Now let’s talk about the objectives of this course. The overall goal of this briefing is to position you to drive transformative change in your organization using AI. The course is structured into three modules. The first module prepares you to be an AI strategist, capable of making strategy and investment decisions. The second module focuses on being a decision-maker at the intersection of technology, data science, and business. The third module develops your AI leadership skills—how to sponsor initiatives, recruit talent, identify risks, manage data, and deliver a roadmap with measurable return on investment.

Within each of these modules, there is a clear learning path. Becoming a strategist means building core knowledge and learning how to make informed investment decisions. Becoming a decision-maker means understanding the trade-offs and risks in key implementation choices. Becoming an AI leader means knowing how to hire the right skills, identify gaps, build a roadmap, manage research and development, ensure adoption, and prove ROI.

Throughout the course, we’ll examine real commercial applications, from tiny startups to Fortune 500 companies. By the end, you’ll be positioned to drive your own AI initiatives and deliver measurable business results. I strongly believe that these kinds of briefings should be actionable. There’s nothing worse than leaving with lots of ideas but nothing concrete to do. That’s why, at the end of each module, you’ll receive a toolkit that you can put into practice immediately.

The first toolkit is a framework for making strategy and investment decisions around AI initiatives. The second is a framework for implementation decisions—questions such as whether to build domain-specific models or use existing frontier models through paid APIs, always viewed from a commercial perspective. The third, and most important, is a framework for leading AI initiatives with measurable ROI: building roadmaps, accounting for R&D, managing experimentation, handling data, and developing the talent needed for long-term success.

To briefly introduce myself, my name is Donna. I’m the co-founder and CTO of Nebula, an AI startup where I lead software engineering and data science. I spent most of my career at JP Morgan as a managing director, leading a team of about 300 technologists. I began in London, moved to Tokyo, and now live in New York City. Before Nebula, I founded an AI startup called Untapped, which was acquired in 2021. The photo you see is from the Times Square billboard announcing that acquisition—a truly magical moment for me. I don’t show it just to boast, but also because I actually live about one block away from there.

And finally, you’ll see a personal photo of me about to fly a plane. You might think this is because flying is my passion—but quite the opposite. I show it to tell you that while I’m confident in AI, I am completely hopeless at anything involving hand-eye coordination. If you ever board a plane and see me in the cockpit, look for a parachute. But if you join an executive briefing on AI and see that I’m the one leading it, then you’re in the right place.

So, without further ado, let’s talk about what this course is—and what it is not. We will cover foundational knowledge about AI, but we won’t go deep into technical detail. Everything will be framed from a business perspective, equipping you to make strategic decisions. We’ll look at real-world commercial use cases across industries, and I’ll leave you with practical toolkits you can apply immediately, whether you’re a solo founder or a leader at a Fortune 500 company.

What we won’t do is dive into deep technical implementations. We’ll discuss concepts like agents, RAG, fine-tuning, and reasoning models, but always in the context of what you need to know to make business decisions. This is also not about teaching you how to use AI tools personally. Instead, it’s about how to lead your teams in using AI effectively in their work.

One final thing: you get me with the deal. I love answering questions, and I genuinely want you to ask them. You can connect with me on LinkedIn, email me, or reach out on X or YouTube, where I share AI insights for business audiences. I’m highly engaged, and if you contact me, I will respond as soon as I can. I also love building community—connecting business leaders and technologists working in this space—so please take me up on that.

And that concludes the first lecture of the first module. This session was about setting the stage, but we also gained an early, tangible insight into AI agents. I hope you now better understand what they are and why Sam Altman believes this is the year they enter the workforce. In our next session, we’ll begin with definitions and explore the AI landscape and technologies. Some of this may be familiar, and I’ll move quickly, but it’s essential groundwork for making sound business strategy decisions. I’ll see you then.
